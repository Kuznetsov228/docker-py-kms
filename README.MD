[py-kms](https://github.com/SystemRage/py-kms) is a port of node-kms created by cyrozap, which is a port of either the C#, C++, or .NET implementations of KMS Emulator. The original version was written by CODYQX4 and is derived from the reverse-engineered code of Microsoft's official KMS.

These are builds of the Minimal image, with Server 2022 support until the offical docker builds are working again.
